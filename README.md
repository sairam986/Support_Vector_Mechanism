**Project Title** : 

Using the Support_Vector_Mechanisam algorithm of Supervise Machine Learning, Predict Iris.csv dataset to find out species will be same or different

**Problem Statement** : 

A American based botnical garden grow Iris flowers in their Labs but using biotechnology in single tree different type of variety flowers is grow. As a datascience engineer find out how accuracy is there all categories contains same species.

**Task** :

Preproses the data in Skitlearn library
Load the using sklearn model selection default argument
On the bases of your data train , test and split your spm model
Impliment the Support_Vector_Mechanism using Classificer.The SVM must be "Linear"
Train the classifier on the training data
Find the prediction value on the test data
Test the model with help of accuracy, Accuracy should be live in the range of 0 to 1

**Conclusion** : 

According to my support vector mechanism model the species are "Linear". With accuracy of 1.00. Hence Proved model was successfully Implement
